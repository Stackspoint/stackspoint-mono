# Adryx

**Adryx** is a decentralized advertising network built on Solana. It gives developers a transparent, permissionless monetization layer for Web2 apps, mobile apps, and Web3 dApps — while giving advertisers verifiable, fraud-proof campaign tracking and users the option to earn rewards for their attention.

---

## The Problem

Web2 ad networks are opaque, extractive, and inaccessible to Web3 developers. Publishers earn a fraction of what they're owed, metrics can't be audited, and dApp developers have no monetization path at all.

Adryx fixes this.

---

## Features

- **Cross-platform SDK** — React and React Native SDKs for Web2 and Web3 apps
- **On-chain ad tracking** — Impressions and clicks recorded via a Solana program
- **Transparent analytics** — Every metric is verifiable on-chain, no black boxes
- **Micro-rewards** — Users can opt in to earn SOL for engaging with ads
- **Fraud-resistant** — Cryptographic verification makes click fraud impossible
- **Instant payouts** — Revenue flows directly to publisher wallets in SOL

Ad campaigns are registered on-chain. The SDK integrates into any app and reports interactions back to the Solana program. Rewards are distributed transparently based on verified on-chain data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 20+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) 10+
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (for Solana programs)
- [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
- [Anchor CLI](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation) 0.30+

**OR** use Docker (recommended for quick start):

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) 20.10+
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 2.0+

### Quick Start with Docker

The fastest way to run Adryx:

```bash
# Start all services (frontend, backend, database)
./scripts/docker-start.sh

# Or manually with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

Access the application:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:3001/api/docs

See [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md) for detailed Docker instructions.

### Local Development (without Docker)

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Run the frontend

```bash
pnpm dev:frontend
# → http://localhost:3000
```

### Run the backend

```bash
pnpm dev:backend
# → http://localhost:3001
```

### Build the Solana program

```bash
anchor build
```

### Run Solana program tests

```bash
anchor test
```
